# Documentaries Now - a Weekend Saga Project

*Duration: 2 Day Sprint*

## Description

*"Truth is stranger than fiction."*

Documentaries are one of my biggest passions, which is why I spent my weekend writing code to showcase a few of my favorites - as well as my new Saga and advanced SQL skills!

The application I built pulls information from a database where the data is organized into three tables: one for movies, one for genres, and one junction table since the data have a many-to-many relationship.

On load, the home page triggers a Saga function, which triggers a GET request to the server and then the database using a SQL query asking for all movie data. That data is stored in a reducer for each movie poster and title to be displayed on the home page.

Using routes, clicking on a movie poster leads to a details page. This triggers another Saga function which triggers a GET request for both movie and genre data for the specific movie that was clicked. Movie and genre data for that movie are stored in separate reducers and displayed on the details page. From the details page, the user is able to click a button to return to the home page.
